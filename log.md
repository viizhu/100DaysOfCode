# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 26, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Learned Git and GitHub

**Thoughts:** Struggled with connecting local computer to GitHub. But I think I get the basics now. At the very least, I'm able to update this sheet and then push to GitHub, so that's a win.

### Day 1: July 27, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Started day 1 of Wes Bos' Javascript30

**Thoughts:** Completed JS Drum Kit, learned about using ES6 back ticks to call variables within a string, key events, playing audio, and listening for audio end events. William didn't tell me about making commit histories, so there's no history here. But maybe next week we will.

### Day 7: August 13, 2017
**Today's Progress:** tested different logos and layouts for my portfolio and personal business cards

### Day 8: August 14, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Settled on a layout for portfolio

**Thoughts:** I think I'm on the right path now for the portfolio. Going to continue coding it and seeing where it takes me. I'm playing with responsive flexbox right now, but I'm not sure if it would be that beneficial since portfolios are so image heavy? For right now though, it'll be responsive!
