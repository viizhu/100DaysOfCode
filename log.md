# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Refresh on 100 Days of Code, starting with continuing Flexbox Zombies

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of trouble keeping up with 100DaysOfCode and there were many gaps. I found myself getting into the trap of "oh, well, I've had a few days off already, I guess I can take today off too." So finally, I decided to refresh. My old logs can still be viewed at past-log.md, but I wanted to start from Day 1 again and hopefully follow a stricter format going forward.

### Day 2: January 10, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Completed Flexbox Zombies

**Thoughts:** It took a little longer than expected because I went back to write up some notes. But I'm glad I did the exercise, because it was a really fun and cute way to learn! Moving on to a Udemy course I purchased a while back.

### Day 3: January 11, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Web Developer Bootcamp Course at Udemy

**Thoughts:** This Udemy course was recommended, so I've started it. The first few lessons are more review because it's mostly HTML/CSS review.

### Day 4: January 12, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Web Developer Bootcamp Course at Udemy

**Thoughts:** I could probably skip the first bulk of lessons, but I'm listening to them on 2x the speed partially in case I miss something I didn't know before and partially because it's nice to just get a review. I didn't know there were nifty keyboard shortcuts for text editors, though! So that's really cool to learn.

### Day 5: January 13, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Web Developer Bootcamp Course at Udemy

**Thoughts:** Got through to intro to CSS. I really liked this one. Even though I'd already known how to do most of this, it's really good to have the explanations as to WHY they're done the way they are.

### Day 8: January 16, 2018

### Day 9: January 17, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Web Developer Bootcamp Course at Udemy

**Thoughts:** Completed the course through JavaScript functions. Next up are arrays and DOM. So far it's mostly been review, so I can speed through a lot of it. But like I said before, it's really nice to get the review and the exercises he gives are helpful in understanding if I actually know the material or not.

### Day 10: January 18, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Web Developer Bootcamp Course at Udemy

**Thoughts:** Did the section on arrays. Mostly review, still. I did wonder what Array.prototype was, but I couldn't get a clear answer. So making a note here to come back to that once I've completed the JavaScript sections.

### Day 11: January 19, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Web Developer Bootcamp Course at Udemy

**Thoughts:** Got through arrays and objects. Things are starting to get more complicated. I'm going to wait to do the DOM stuff because it's starting to get into territories where I'm not as familiar, so I will probably work through the next few sessions slower.

### Day 15: January 23, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Web Developer Bootcamp Course at Udemy

**Thoughts:** Started the Color Game app. I've decided to try it all myself before listening to how he does it. I downloaded the barebones HTML and CSS to begin and then coded all the JavaScript. Next step is making everything look pretty and creating the navbar/links.

### Day 22: January 30, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Web Developer Bootcamp Course at Udemy

**Thoughts:** Mostly completed the to do list. Just one minor error where the input toggle stops working after you insert new to do items. Will take a look and debug. (Edit: .toggle() is a jQuery UI function, so I removed that function altogether and everything works now!)

### Day 23: January 31, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Web Developer Bootcamp Course at Udemy

**Thoughts:** Watched through how he did the to do list. He used CSS transition to make the delete buttons move, so that was fun to learn. I'd assumed that everything would be done with jQuery.
