# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 26, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Learned Git and GitHub

**Thoughts:** Struggled with connecting local computer to GitHub. But I think I get the basics now. At the very least, I'm able to update this sheet and then push to GitHub, so that's a win.

### Day 1: July 27, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Started day 1 of Wes Bos' Javascript30

**Thoughts:** Completed JS Drum Kit, learned about using ES6 back ticks to call variables within a string, key events, playing audio, and listening for audio end events. William didn't tell me about making commit histories, so there's no history here. But maybe next week we will.
