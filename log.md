# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Refresh on 100 Days of Code, starting with continuing Flexbox Zombies

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of trouble keeping up with 100DaysOfCode and there were many gaps. I found myself getting into the trap of "oh, well, I've had a few days off already, I guess I can take today off too." So finally, I decided to refresh. My old logs can still be viewed at past-log.md, but I wanted to start from Day 1 again and hopefully follow a stricter format going forward.

### Day 2: January 10, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Completed Flexbox Zombies

**Thoughts:** It took a little longer than expected because I went back to write up some notes. But I'm glad I did the exercise, because it was a really fun and cute way to learn! Moving on to a Udemy course I purchased a while back.

### Day 3: January 11, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Web Developer Bootcamp Course at Udemy

**Thoughts:** This Udemy course was recommended, so I've started it. The first few lessons are more review because it's mostly HTML/CSS review.
