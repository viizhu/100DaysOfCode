# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 26, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Learned Git and GitHub

**Thoughts:** Struggled with connecting local computer to GitHub. But I think I get the basics now. At the very least, I'm able to update this sheet and then push to GitHub, so that's a win.

### Day 1: July 27, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Started day 1 of Wes Bos' Javascript30

**Thoughts:** Completed JS Drum Kit, learned about using ES6 back ticks to call variables within a string, key events, playing audio, and listening for audio end events. William didn't tell me about making commit histories, so there's no history here. But maybe next week we will.

### Day 2: July 28, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Completed day 2 of Wes Bos' Javascript30 challenge

**Thoughts:** Managed to write a little of it myself this time, and had some commit history for Git. Had a bit of a hard time mathing the hours into degrees to show up on the clock, but otherwise it actually wasn't too bad. Also updated my portfolio with recent layouts.

### Day 7: August 13, 2017
**Today's Progress:** tested different logos and layouts for my portfolio and personal business cards

**Thoughts:** In personal life news, we got a new kitten. So I took a long break from coding to help the kitten settle in and help our puppy get used to not being an only furchild anymore. Getting back into things slowly by working on my portfolio. Trying to figure out a nice logo to go with my "personal brand" and also a clean layout.

### Day 8: August 14, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Settled on a layout for portfolio

**Thoughts:** I think I'm on the right path now for the portfolio. Going to continue coding it and seeing where it takes me. I'm playing with responsive flexbox right now, but I'm not sure if it would be that beneficial since portfolios are so image heavy? For right now though, it'll be responsive!

### Day 9: August 16, 2017
**Today's Progress:** I think I'm good with this new layout! \o/

**Thoughts:** I think I'm finally settled on a new layout! Though I may have to make an about me page with this new layout...  I like this new layout but I just realized that I can't do everything in one page if I go with this. Decisions decisions...
