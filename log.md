# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Refresh on 100 Days of Code, starting with continuing Flexbox Zombies

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of trouble keeping up with 100DaysOfCode and there were many gaps. I found myself getting into the trap of "oh, well, I've had a few days off already, I guess I can take today off too." So finally, I decided to refresh. My old logs can still be viewed at past-log.md, but I wanted to start from Day 1 again and hopefully follow a stricter format going forward.

### Day 2: January 10, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Completed Flexbox Zombies

**Thoughts:** It took a little longer than expected because I went back to write up some notes. But I'm glad I did the exercise, because it was a really fun and cute way to learn! Moving on to a Udemy course I purchased a while back.

### Day 3: January 11, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Web Developer Bootcamp Course at Udemy

**Thoughts:** This Udemy course was recommended, so I've started it. The first few lessons are more review because it's mostly HTML/CSS review.

### Day 4: January 12, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Web Developer Bootcamp Course at Udemy

**Thoughts:** I could probably skip the first bulk of lessons, but I'm listening to them on 2x the speed partially in case I miss something I didn't know before and partially because it's nice to just get a review. I didn't know there were nifty keyboard shortcuts for text editors, though! So that's really cool to learn.

### Day 5: January 13, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Web Developer Bootcamp Course at Udemy

**Thoughts:** Got through to intro to CSS. I really liked this one. Even though I'd already known how to do most of this, it's really good to have the explanations as to WHY they're done the way they are.

### Day 9: January 17, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Web Developer Bootcamp Course at Udemy

**Thoughts:** Completed the course through JavaScript functions. Next up are arrays and DOM. So far it's mostly been review, so I can speed through a lot of it. But like I said before, it's really nice to get the review and the exercises he gives are helpful in understanding if I actually know the material or not.
